Even Fibonacci numbers

Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Fibonacci function, using the closed form inside a loop
```{r}
# Golden ratio
g = (1 + 5**.5) / 2

# Function to find Nth fibonacci number, and form an array through recursion
fib = function(x) {
  
  arr = numeric(x)
  
  for (N in 1:x){
    arr[N] = (g**N - (1-g)**N) / 5**.5
  } 
  
  arr
}

```

```{r}
N = 8

g = (1 + 5**.5) / 2

(g**N - (1-g)**N) / 5**.5
```
