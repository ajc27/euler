Multiples of 3 and 5
   
Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Make vector of numbers up to 1000
```{r}
  x = c(1:999)
  
```

subset x using the'[' operator, '%%' modulo, and '|' pipe, which means 'or'
```{r}
a = x[x %% 3 == 0 | x %% 5 == 0]
```

```{r}
sum(a)
```
