Sum square difference
  
Problem 6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12+22+...+102=385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Could do this through brute force, calculating the sq of the sum and the sum of the sq, but suspect there's a more elegant way...

Brute force attack...

```{r}

N = 100

sumofsqs = function(a) {
  ar = c(1:N)  
  sq = ar^2
  return(sum(sq))
}

sqofsum = function(a){
  ar = c(1:N)
  return(sum(ar)^2)
}


ans = abs(diff(c(sumofsqs(N), sqofsum(N))))
```


Ok this works fine!

But for reference, here is a nicer way..

square of the sum: (1 + 2 + ... + n)^2 = n^2 * (n+1)^2 * 1/4
sum of the sq: 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = n * (n+1) * (2n+1) * 1/6
